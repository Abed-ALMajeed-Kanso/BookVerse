BookVerse is an API project built with Node.js that provides a platform for managing and reviewing books. It utilizes session management 
and JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure user authentication and authorization. Designed with RESTful APIs, it allows users to register, log in, 
and perform operations like adding, updating, and deleting reviews for books. The project was a part of a course I completed on Coursera.
